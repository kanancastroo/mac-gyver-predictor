Negotiation and collaboration for resource allocation and demand efficiency
Resolution of potencial conflicts
system disruption responses and minimization of  the overall costs of satisfying total demand from the system in these events
agents perform different functions based on their unique advantages relative to other agents postdisruption
coordination mechanism, dynamic reorganization and coordination of the network under a disruption
Different responses according to different demand/response schemes (price-based)
decision about the best control design of the Smart Grid
to proactively plan the DC operation as a system to be able to exploit its latent flexible energy to achieve a deeper and more efficient integration with the local Smart Grid.
to use as much as possible of the locally produced renewable energy and transact energy to decrease operational costs, optimizing its integration in smart grid advanced context.
optimizations of the decisions of the Smart Grid given the best control design
distributed negotiations between groups
energy consumption/production patterns
demand side management
peak optimization
battery storage models
market mechanisms
cluster together into local energy collectives
use storage and demand-response techniques
balance energy consumption and production
deploy batteries in different ways depending on the behaviour of their members
promote to use a VPP from a new electricity production cost policy
optimise energy usage in a range of weather conditions
Optimize the overall charging behavior
avoid many simultaneous charging cycles
minimum peak loads emerging
cost limits are not exceeded
balance between energy production and consumption
grid stability
load-generation balance
control the battery and enhance the operation of the system
decrease the power consumption from power utility by using available energy from the solar panels
supply power power to the electric load
supply power to homes even in the event of an electric grid outage
to ensure the comfort of its occupants by enhancing the automation to relief them from manual control of different services while increasing the energy savings
minimize the average vehicle waiting time in the network
minimize the local waiting time for vehicles
north-to-south, red-to-green transition times
